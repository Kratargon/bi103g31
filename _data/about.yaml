Abstract: >
  The subject of this research is to consider several methods for modelling the 
  distribution of microtubule catastrophe times and determine both which method is 
  more accurate, and what the parameters give the most accurate distribution for that 
  method.
  
  To this end, we compare data generated using distributions with real gathered data.
  
  In our analysis, we first determine whether the data is more accurately modelled 
  with a gamma distribution or a proposed distribution where two successive arrival 
  events with arrival rates beta 1 and beta 2 are necessary for catastrophe. We 
  computed the MLEs of the data both of these distributions and compared the results 
  graphically. We also computed the AIC and concluded that the gamma distribution 
  refleccted our data more accurately.
  
  We proceeded to model the data with the gamma distribution and compute confidence
  intervals for our MLE parameters, alpha and beta, in order to analyze our microtubule 
  catastrophe behavior. The beta values were consistent throughout. The confidence 
  intervals for the alpha values were very similar between the 7 uM and 9 uM trials 
  and between the 10 uM and 12 uM trials. The alpha of the 10 uM and 12 uM trials were 
  larger than the 7 uM and 9 uM trials with significant non-overlap between their 
  confidence intervals, but the 14 uM trial had the largest alpha values with little 
  confidence interval overlap with either of them. Thus we concluded that the rates of 
  arrival (beta) remain somewhat consistent across concentrations, but the number of 
  arrivals (alpha) increase with increasing concentrations.
